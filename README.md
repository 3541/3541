### Greetings
I'm a computer science student at the University of Melbourne. I'm fascinated by systems programming and OS internals.

### Current Projects
I'm currently primarily working on [Short Circuit](https://github.com/3541/short-circuit), an `io_uring` web server for Linux. My long-term background project is [Syzygy](https://github.com/3541/syzygy), an experimental kernel in Rust, which, given the scale of such a project, I expect never to be finished.

### Keys and Commit Signing
My PGP key ID is `0x1EECFF9EE39ED7AA`.

As of 2021-01-09, my commits _should_ all be signed with `0xDA46358D112CAF45`, which is a subkey of the above. However, given that I'm highly unlikely to be the target of nefarious supply chain attacks, a missing signature on one of my commits is far more likely to be a result of a Yubikey failure or something similar than anything actually concerning.
